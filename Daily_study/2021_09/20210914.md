<h2>Python</h2>

* installing Python 3 & PyCharm

* Variables

* Receiving Input

  ```python
  print('Enter your name:')
  x = input()
  print('Hello, ' + x)
  ```

  Input() receives the input value as a string.

* Type Conversion

  ```python
  number = '10'
  int_num = int(number)
  ```

  Strings

  Python can use a negative index.

  ```python
  name = 'Jennifer'
  print(name[1:-1])
  
  result : ennife
  ```

* Formatted Strings

  ```python
  first = 'John'
  last = 'Smith'
  msg = f'{first} [{last}] is a coder'
  print(msg)
  
  result : John [Smith] is a coder
  ```

  To define formatted strings prefix your strings with an F and then use curly braces to dynamically insert values into your strings.

* String Methods

  ```python
  course = 'Python for Beginners'
  print(course)
  print(len(course))
  print(course.upper())
  print(course.lower())
  print(course.replace('Beginners', 'Absolute Begeinners'))
  print(course.find('P'))
  // return the index of character or sequence of characters
  print('Python' in course)
  // return boolean value
  
  result : 
  20
