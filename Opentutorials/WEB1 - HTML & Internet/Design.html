    Noctua's computer fan products are well-known for their characteristic brown and beige colour scheme, which has
    divided opinions among customers and enthusiasts.[11] The colour scheme has been criticized, which PC Gamer called
    an "ugly ... khaki-and-mud color scheme straight out of the '70s".

    In recent years, Noctua has produced more conventional colour schemes under their chromax line that includes black
    editions of their popular CPU coolers and fans, as well as various coloured heatsink covers, cables, and
    anti-vibration accessories. Noctua announced all-black versions of their most popular CPU coolers in the
    chromax.black series for the first time at Computex Taipei in 2018, and formally introduced them in October
    2019.

    Noctua also has a redux line that features reissues of some of their most popular fans and coolers at a reduced
    price, in a light/dark grey color scheme. Fans in the redux line lack much of the technology found in the standard
    line, feature Noctua's first-gen SSO bearing, and come with no accessories.
